# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

This week I learned about tracing and observability.
I was able to start a trace and a span by using Honeycomb.
I was able to start a segment and a subsegment by using Xray.
I was able to start logging on CloudWatch by using watchtower library.
I read the article written by Olley that she has written on how to solve th problem we had on subsegmentation by using Xray.
I studied how to code effectively by using Object Oriented Programming principles in python. I used one of the CMU Computer science python courses to pratice these concepts.
I was able to display an error in my code by using Rollbar.
I also watched opencloud video for cloud careers and decided to pursue with an engineering role. i will be learning git, terraform, jenkins and kubernetes.
So far I enjoy being part of the project bootcamp. I am excited to watch, learn and do more every week.
